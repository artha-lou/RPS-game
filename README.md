# RPS-game
**Project Goals** 

This project allows the user to practice basic javascript/HTML/CSS code.

**First Phase** 
The goal of this project is to allow the user to create a rock paper scissors game that is interactive and seen in the console 
when utilizing developer. 
Java is written within the script of html for this project. 

**Second Phase** 
Javascript is deleted within the html and linked as a script. The script is updated so that the player may select a button (rock, paper, or scissors)
which then triggers an eventListener function in JavaScript. This allows several functions to update (computer selection, player selection, player/ comp lives, and final winner) at the trigger of each selection. The format
of the game is quite simple. Console.logs used in phase one were transitioned into DOM methods. A running score
is displayed and announces a winner when the first player reaches zero lives. No UX is involved in this, very
robust UI.
